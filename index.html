Patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk groups can take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (marketed as Paxlovid) or remdesivir, either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or hospitalization. In the US, the Biden Administration COVID-19 action plan includes the Test to Treat initiative, where people can go to a pharmacy, take a COVID test, and immediately receive free Paxlovid if they test positive.    Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important. </section>   <article> The cornerstone of management of COVID-19 has been supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs. Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing. Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended. As of April 2020 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.</article>                  </div>  <aside> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/An_overview_of_COVID-19_therapeutics_and_drugs.webp/330px-An_overview_of_COVID-19_therapeutics_and_drugs.webp.png"alt= ""width= "400" height="250">As of November 2020 use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone had been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels, to reduce the risk of death. Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.Some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so-called cytokine storm. </aside>  <footer>  <address>    No. 76 Ahlone TownShip,<br>    Yangon   </address>   <p> Copyright &copy; 2022 Azura Compute Inc. - Term of Use - Privacy Policy - Editorial Review Policy </p>   </footer></body></html>
